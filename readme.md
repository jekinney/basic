## Basic Site Scaffolding

Super basic site scaffolding to help me when I start a simple project.

- Routes set with proper middleware
- Auth and registering set up (beyond default)
- Simple Dashboard with users and roles pages
- Default Bootstrap front end layout with modified routes
- Page controller to control static pages (about us etc.)
- Single role and permissions set up for semi-advanced ACL

## Future features
- Newsletter system
- File uploads for distributing
- Image upload and Carousel images
- Simple blog with one depth comments
- Simple Contact us page and functionality 
- Static page upgrades to enable editing from dashboard

## Overview

For me, I generally develop small mom and pop type or personal sites a lot, with out much intergration into other software or enterprise api's etc..
So instead of copy and pasting or installing packages I decided to try and create a scaffolding project to start my projects with.

I'll add features as I need them (some listed above I have built before) and in no particular order other then the need arises.
